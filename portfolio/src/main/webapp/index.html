    <h1>Connor's Portfolio</h1>
    <img class="avatar" src="https://i.imgur.com/AW18kUT.png" alt="avatar" />
    <p>My name is Connor and I am a rising junior at University of Arizona studying Computer Science.</p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I grew up in Campbell, CA and discovered my interest and love for computers at a very young age. I first
      started playing games like Pajama Sam on the computer which then grew into a passion for video games which I
      still have today. I took my first coding class sophomore year of high school which captured my interest in
      CS. After taking more coding classes in high school, I continued in college and majored in Computer Science.
      After my first year, I managed to secure an internship at a small company where I learned fundamentals of
      software development like debugging and testing. My second year of school both exposed me to new areas of
      computer science and pushed me harder than I had before. This combined with what I learned from my first
      internship helped prepare me for this opportunity at Google.</p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I worked on the Google Voice integration portion of a GNSS Tracking Application for a hacakthon which
        ended up winning! I used DialogFlow to parse input from the user and send a request to a database which
        would then report back to the user.</li>
      <br />
      <li>Joined the hackathon team for the event I previously mentioned and did some development on the website.
        Learned a lot about front end development (HTML, CSS, JS).</li>
    </ul>
